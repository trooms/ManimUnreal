# ManimUnreal

**ManimUnreal** is a WIP scientific visualization tool developed for use in Unreal Engine, inspired by [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

Designed to empower researchers, educators, and the alike, ManimUnreal will enable the creation of high-quality, low-code educational materials by taking advantage of Unreal's [Blueprints Visual Scripting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine).
